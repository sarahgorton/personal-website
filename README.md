<p>Sarah Gorton's Tech Portfolio </p>
<p>For this project, I set out to create my portfolio website with the purpose of showcasing 
myself and my abilities both on a personal level and on an educational level. </p>

<p>I chose to host this page using my GitHub repository as this allowed for the opportunity 
to gain a better understanding web development and the capabilities of GitHub. Post project 
completion, my understanding of html, css, and GitHub increased significantly. </p>
